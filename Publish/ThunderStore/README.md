# ExtraSnapPointsMadeEasy
This is a quality of life building mod that:
- Adds snap points to most vanilla items in the game that did not have them.
- Adds extra snap points to wooden beams at the halfway points.
- Allows for manual selection of snap points for both the piece you are placing and the piece you are snapping to.

## New Snap Points
New snap points have been added to most crafting and furniture items. Snap points on items like chests, torches, sconces, and banners. Snap points have been chosen to minimize clipping when snapping banners and sconces to walls of any material.

## Extra Snap Points
Extra snap points at the halfway position have been added to all wooden beams and the diagonal wood wall pieces.

## Manual Snapping
Press a key to toggle Manual Snapping Mode, which allows you to cycle through various snap-points when targeting a piece in game - without needing to point at them directly with the mouse!

The key-binds for manual snapping are configurable via editing of the configuration file at Valheim/BepInEx/config/searica.valheim.extrasnappointsmadeeasy.cfg or via an in-game configuration manager (live updates, no restart required).

The default key-bindings are:
- Toggle Snapping Mode: Left-Alt
- Cycle Snap Points on the piece you are placing (source piece): Left-Ctrl
- Cycle Snap Points ont he piece you are snapping to (target piece): Left-Shift

Usage: Grab a hammer and select a piece to place. Hit Left-Alt to enable Manual Snapping Mode, a notification will then appear int he center of your screen indicating whether the snapping mode is set to Auto or Manual. Point your piece at the piece you want to snap to and hit Left-Control to cycle through the snap points on the piece you're holding. Use Left-Shift to cycle through destination snap points. For example you can snap a horizontal pillar to the middle of the vertical pillar by cycling both to their midpoint snap points. While cycling through snap points you will also receive notifications indicating which snap point is currently selected on each piece.
